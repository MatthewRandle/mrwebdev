                            <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
                            <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
                            
                            <p>It is Mr Web Dev's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
                                website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://misterweb.dev">https://misterweb.dev</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we",
                                or "https://misterweb.dev"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information
                                you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what
                                information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
                                disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the
                                Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and
                                policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be
                                required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                            <p>Like most website operators, Mr Web Dev collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
                                and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
                                and time of each visitor request. Mr Web Dev's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
                                better understand how Mr Web Dev's visitors use its website. From time to time, Mr Web Dev may release
                                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
                                website.</p>
                            <p>Mr Web Dev also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
                                logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://misterweb.dev blog posts. Mr Web Dev only discloses logged in
                                user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
                                information as described below.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                            <p>Certain visitors to Mr Web Dev's websites choose to interact with Mr Web Dev in ways that require Mr Web Dev to
                                gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Mr Web Dev gathers depends on the
                                nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://misterweb.dev to provide a
                                username and email address.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Security</h2>
                            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
                                Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
                                protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                            
                            
                            
                            <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
                            <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you
                                will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and
                                conditions of every site you visit.</p>
                            <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
                                party sites, products or services.</p>
                            
                            
                            
                            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                            <p>Mr Web Dev may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Mr Web Dev may display this
                                information publicly or provide it to others. However, Mr Web Dev does not disclose your personally-identifying
                                information.</p>
                            
                            
                            <h2>Cookies</h2>
                            <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Mr Web Dev uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided
                                by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
                            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
                                provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Mr Web Dev uses cookies to help Mr Web Dev identify and track
                                visitors, their usage of https://misterweb.dev, and their website access preferences. Mr Web Dev visitors who do not
                                wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Mr Web Dev's
                                websites, with the drawback that certain features of Mr Web Dev's websites may not function properly without the aid
                                of cookies.</p>
                            <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to Mr
                                Web Dev's use of cookies.</p>
                            
                            
                            <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
                            <p>If Mr Web Dev, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Mr Web Dev goes out
                                of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
                                third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Mr Web Dev may continue to use
                                your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
                            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Mr Web Dev may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Mr
                                Web Dev's sole discretion. Mr Web Dev encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
                                Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
                                acceptance of such change.</p>
